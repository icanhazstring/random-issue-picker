# Random Issue Picker

The random issue picker, can be used to pick surprisingly random issues in your preferred langauge.

Requirements:

## How to use it

```

As a preparation for the [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) we have added some features to support langauge and label as input parameter, so now you can use

```shell
$ bin/rip random:issue -l php --label hacktoberfest
```

Default values:

| Parameter        |  Default Value       |
|------------------|----------------------|
| --language, -l   | php                  |

run the tool and every check using `docker`. There is `Makefile` present to support your work.

You can run `make up` to build the image and run the container.
> For more available commands refer to the [Makefile](Makefile)

After you have done this, you can install the dependencies using `make composer install`.
If you made you changed, create a pull request and you are ready to go.
